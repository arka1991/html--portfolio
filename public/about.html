<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Arka Joardar. I am a village-born Electrical Engineer currently working in the Government sector.

<p>I have a strong interest in learning new things and applying them in real life. At present, I am learning the basics of web development. I have already created websites using WordPress, but to gain full control and deeper understanding, I decided to start learning HTML and core web technologies from scratch.
</p>
<p>My goal is to build a basic functional website within the next four months and gradually expand my skills. My long-term dream is to create a web-based system that can automatically generate Excel estimates, manage material inventory, and track site conditions—tools that are essential for Junior Engineers in my field.
</p>
<p>I believe continuous learning and practical implementation are the keys to growth, and I am committed to turning my ideas into reality.</p>
